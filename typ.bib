that translates a subset of the C language into the Cminor
intermediate language.  The semantics of the source and target
languages as well as the translation between them have been written in
the specification language of the Coq proof assistant. The proof of
observational semantic equivalence between the source and generated
code has been machine-checked using Coq.  An executable compiler was
obtained by automatic extraction of executable Caml code from the Coq
specification of the translator, combined with a certified compiler
back-end generating PowerPC assembly code from Cminor, described in
previous work.},

@inproceedings{Cousot77,
    abstract = {A program denotes computations in some universe of objects.
      Abstract interpretation of programs consists in using that denotation to
        describe computations in another universe of abstract objects, so that
        the results of abstract execution give some information on the actual
        computations. An intuitive example (which we borrow from Sintzoff [72])
        is the rule of signs. The text -1515 * 17 may be understood to denote
        computations on the abstract universe {(+), (-), (±)} where the
        semantics of arithmetic operators is defined by the rule of signs. The
        abstract execution -1515 * 17 → -(+) * (+) → (-) * (+) → (-), proves
        that -1515 * 17 is a negative number. Abstract interpretation is
        concerned by a particular underlying structure of the usual universe of
        computations (the sign, in our example). It gives a summary of some
        facets of the actual executions of a program. In general this summary is
        simple to obtain but inaccurate (e.g. -1515 + 17 → -(+) + (+) → (-) +
            (+) → (±)). Despite its fundamentally incomplete results abstract
        interpretation allows the programmer or the compiler to answer questions
        which do not need full knowledge of program executions or which tolerate
        an imprecise answer, (e.g. partial correctness proofs of programs
            ignoring the termination problems, type checking, program
            optimizations which are not carried in the absence of certainty
            about their feasibility, …).},

    abstract = {{This paper presents an embedded security sublanguage for
      enforcing information-flow policies in the standard Haskell programming
        language. The sublanguage provides useful information-flow control
        mechanisms including dynamic security lattices, run-time code privileges
        and declassification, without modifying the base language. This design
        avoids the redundant work of producing new languages, lowers the
        threshold for adopting security-typed languages, and also provides great
        flexibility and modularity for using security-policy frameworks. The
        embedded security sublanguage is designed using a standard combinator
        interface called arrows. Computations constructed in the sublanguage
        have static and explicit control-flow components, making it possible to
        implement information-flow control using static-analysis techniques at
        run time, while providing strong security guarantees. This paper
        presents a concrete Haskell implementation and an example application
        demonstrating the proposed techniques.}},

@book{UnderstandingTheLinuxKernel,
    abstract = {{In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so
well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of
the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the
external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in
what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can
share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that
the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow
disks.

The third edition of \_Understanding the Linux Kernel\_ takes you on a guided
tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming
tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors
offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work
inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed.
Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more
than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical
underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.

This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant
changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory
management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:

  * Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct
memory Access (DMA)

  * The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems

  * Process creation and scheduling

  * Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers

  * Timing

  * Synchronization within the kernel

  * Interprocess Communication (IPC)

  * Program execution

\_Understanding the Linux Kernel\_ will acquaint you with all the inner workings
of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what
conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the
challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file
access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book
will help you make the most of your Linux system.}},

      string security vulnerabilities in C programs using a constraint-based
        type-inference engine. We describe new techniques for presenting the
        results of such an analysis to the user in a form that makes bugs easier
        to find and to fix. The system has been implemented and tested on
        several real-world software packages. Our tests show that the system is
        very effective, detecting several bugs previously unknown to the authors
        and exhibiting a low rate of false positives in almost all cases. Many
        of our techniques are applicable to additional classes of security
        vulnerabilities, as well as other type-and constraint-based systems.}},
